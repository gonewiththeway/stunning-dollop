# Installation Instructions
```bundle install
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails db:seed
bundle exec rails server
```

You can add a vagrant box which comes with all the dependencies. I used https://app.vagrantup.com/nu12/boxes/rails-mysql.
# What am I proud?

This is a fairly lightweight app which combines bootstrap 4, mysql, db tables, tests, rspecs, jquery and a basic navigation flow to create a basic payroll system. The code follows MVC architecture.
I am proud of the way all of the above technologies and paradigms combine to create an app which is easily extensible and 
can be deployed at a full scale production server.
